#### PLEASE NOTE
This is not a kaggle competition. The results of your model won't be rankend against the others.
The goal is not to have the best performing model but rather to implement an end-to-end solution including 
all the stages of the ML lifecycle. So don't spend too much time on tuning one particular model, rather try
to understand why one model may apply better than the other.
